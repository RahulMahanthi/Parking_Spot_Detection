# ðŸš— Parking Spot Detection using YOLO ðŸš—

This project implements a **Parking Spot Detection System** using the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection algorithm. The system is designed to automatically identify available parking spots in real-time, making parking lot management more efficient.

## âš¡ Features âš¡

- **Real-time detection** of available parking spots
- Fast and **accurate object detection** using **YOLOv4**
- Works with **video streams** or **static images**
- Visual feedback with **bounding boxes** to mark available parking spaces

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements ðŸ“‹

To run this project, make sure you have the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV**
- **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** (depending on the YOLO version used)
- **NumPy**
- **YOLOv8 weights and configuration files**

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy
